                    <h5>Money Madness</h5>
                    <p>A lot of people do it for the money. Money seems to be to only value of success in today's society, but it's not. It feels good to be rich and never have to worry about being poor, but can you really equate your happiness to monetary value? Every time I spend money on something, I have to consider the feeling of emptiness that comes after time passes. Eventually, I began to see memories more valuable than dollar bills. The memories in which you share with family, mates, or strangers you meet in every day life are not something you can purchase with monetary value, rather it would be with time. Simply, money cannot buy time. Money cannot buy the life of a man, but rather the time spent in CPR training to save him. Money cannot buy away the insufferable pain a child would physically feel and the family would emotionally endure from a vehicular collision, but rather the time to understand a moral compass and sacrifice against all odds pull her to the pavement. Money cannot buy a life of memories, but time can.</p>
                    <h5>Becoming a Doctor</h5>
                    <p>The saving of a life, whether you are a doctor or not, is an unforgettable memory. These are the memories in which I desire to continuously grow and create throughout life. People say it's hard becoming a doctor, however I disagree. I believe that everyone could be a doctor as long as we try are best and hardest to become one. Being a doctor isn't about the cutting, but rather the healing physically and/or mentally. They symbolic nature of a doctor is to show strength through caring, which is what I believe we can all do.</p>
                    <h5>Words To Live By</h5>
                    <p>I know that my years in education are quite early, but I would like to mention some of the things that help me push on to my final goal. The first thing that kept me on track to medical school is "The Want For a Nail" proverb. Before high school graduation, I planned on studying computer science at university, but thinking back to events that had occurred with this proverb, I wondered where in the link of society where the fear of medical school and becoming a doctor would end. I didn't want to become the soldier who lost the war because of a simple desire (quite the slippery slope), so I decided that it would end at me. The goal in becoming a doctor wasn't to prove to my family or society that I was better or a man of greater good, but rather me proving to myself that I am better than who I once believed to be. In all, I do hope that me becoming a doctor will inspire those who may have lost confidence to continue pursuing this lucrative career in creating memories of a lifetime.</p>
